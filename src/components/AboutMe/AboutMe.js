          I am a software developer currently seeking new opportunities. 
          My passions are programming and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). 
          I like to learn new technologies and to apply them at work. My degree 
          is in GIS, and I have been studying web development over the past couple 
          years. I like mastering new technologies. It makes me feel powerful, like 
          a wizard who can conjure spells out of text. The human side of me thinks VR 
          applications are cool. In my free time I play around with building VR apps in Unity.
